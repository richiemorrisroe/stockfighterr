* stockfighterr

An R client for the stockfighter API (https://www.stockfighter.io). 

Implements all of the HTTP functions from [[https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/][the docs]], with the exception of the two websocket functions. 

Unfortunately R does not currently possess a websocket client, so those functions are missing, as of now.
